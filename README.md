## Quickstarter template

This template contains all the required installation instructions, scripts, files, and functions for:
- Building Bittensor subnets
- Creating custom incentive mechanisms and running these mechanisms on the subnets

In order to simplify the building of subnets, this template abstracts away the complexity of the underlying blockchain and other boilerplate code. While the default behavior of the template is sufficient for a simple subnet, you should customize the template to meet your specific requirements.

## Introduction

Welcome to the OMEGA Labs Bittensor subnet, a groundbreaking initiative that aims to create the world's largest decentralized multimodal dataset for accelerating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and development. Our mission is to democratize access to a vast and diverse dataset that captures the landscape of human knowledge and creation, empowering researchers and developers to push the boundaries of AGI.

By harnessing the power of the Bittensor network and a global community of miners and validators, we are building a dataset that surpasses the scale and diversity of existing resources. With over 1 million hours of footage and 30 million+ 2-minute video clips, the OMEGA Labs dataset will enable the development of powerful AGI models and transform various industries.

### Example

The Bittensor Subnet 1 for Text Prompting is built using this template. See [Bittensor Text-Prompting](https://github.com/opentensor/text-prompting) for how to configure the files and how to add monitoring and telemetry and support multiple miner types. Also, see this Subnet 1 in action on the [Taostats](https://taostats.io/subnets/netuid-1/) explorer.

## Key Features

- üåç **Unparalleled Scale and Diversity**: 1 million+ hours of footage, 30 million+ video clips, covering 50+ scenarios and 15,000+ action phrases.
- üß† **Latent Representations**: Leveraging state-of-the-art models to translate video components into a unified latent space for efficient processing.
- üí∞ **Incentivized Data Collection**: Rewarding miners for contributing high-quality, diverse, and novel videos through a decentralized network.
- ü§ñ **Empowering Digital Agents**: Enabling the development of intelligent agents that can navigate complex workflows and assist users across platforms.
- üéÆ **Immersive Gaming Experiences**: Facilitating the creation of realistic gaming environments with rich physics and interactions.

## Miner and Validator Functionality

### Miner

- Performs a simple search on YouTube and retrieves 8 videos at a time.
- Provides a certain clip range (maximum of 2 minutes) and a description (catch) which includes the title, tags, and description of the video.
- Obtains the ImageBind embeddings for the video, audio, and caption.
- Returns the video ID, caption, ImageBind embeddings (video, audio, caption embeddings), and start and end times for the clips (maximum of 2 minutes).

### Validator

- Takes the received videos from the miners and randomly selects one video for validation.
- Computes the ImageBind embeddings for all three modalities (video, audio, caption) of the selected video.
- Compares the quality of the embeddings to ensure they are consistent with the miner's submissions.
- If the selected video passes the validation, assumes all eight videos from the miner are valid.
- Scores the videos based on relevance, novelty, and detail richness:
  - Relevance: Calculated using cosine similarity between the topic embedding and each of the eight videos.
  - Novelty: For each video, finds the closest video in the Pinecone index and computes 1 - similarity.
    - Potential issue: Choosing the second most similar video instead of the most similar one.
  - Detail Richness: Determined by the cosine similarity between the text and video embeddings.
- Collects 1024 validated video entries and pushes them to Hugging Face as a file, which is then concatenated.
  - If a miner submits too frequently, the validator may increase the file threshold accumulation limit.
  - If the API needs to shut down for any reason, it will submit the remaining validated entries.

- [ ] Incentivize people to record and label their own data using non-deep learning approaches

## Installation

### Before you proceed
Before you proceed with the installation of the subnet, note the following: 

- Use these instructions to run your subnet locally for your development and testing, or on the Bittensor testnet or mainnet. 
- **IMPORTANT**: We **strongly recommend** that you first run your subnet locally and complete your development and testing before running the subnet on the Bittensor testnet. Furthermore, make sure that you next run your subnet on the Bittensor testnet before running it on the mainnet.
- You can run your subnet either as a subnet owner, validator, or miner. 
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you are aware of the minimum compute requirements for your subnet. See the [Minimum compute YAML configuration](./min_compute.yml).
- Note that installation instructions differ based on your situation. For example, installing for local development and testing will require a few additional steps compared to installing for testnet. Similarly, installation instructions differ for a subnet owner vs a validator or a miner. 

### Install

- **Running locally**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running Subnet Locally](./docs/running_on_staging.md).
- **Running on Bittensor testnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Test Network](./docs/running_on_testnet.md).
- **Running on Bittensor mainnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Main Network](./docs/running_on_mainnet.md).

## Writing your own incentive mechanism

When you are ready to write your own incentive mechanism, update this template repository by editing the following files:
- `template/protocol.py`: Contains the definition of the wire-protocol used by miners and validators.
- `neurons/miner.py`: Script that defines the miner's behavior, i.e., how the miner responds to requests from validators.
- `neurons/validator.py`: This script defines the validator's behavior, i.e., how the validator requests information from the miners and determines the scores.
- `template/forward.py`: Contains the definition of the validator's forward pass.
- `template/reward.py`: Contains the definition of how validators reward miner responses.

In addition to the above files, you should also update the following files:
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for your project. Update this file to reflect your project's documentation.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: This file contains the instructions for contributing to your project. Update this file to reflect your project's contribution guidelines.
- `template/__init__.py`: This file contains the version of your project.
- `setup.py`: This file contains the metadata about your project. Update this file to reflect your project's metadata.
- `docs/`: This directory contains the documentation for your project. Update this directory to reflect your project's documentation.

__Note__: The `template` directory should be renamed to your project name.

## Writing your own subnet API
To leverage the abstract `SubnetsAPI` in Bittensor, you can implement a standardized interface. This interface is used to interact with the Bittensor network and can be used by a client to interact with the subnet through its exposed axons.

Bittensor communication typically involves two processes:
1. Preparing data for transit (creating and filling `synapse`s)
2. Processing the responses received from the `axon`(s)

This protocol uses a handler registry system to associate bespoke interfaces for subnets by implementing two simple abstract functions:
- `prepare_synapse`
- `process_responses`

These can be implemented as extensions of the generic `SubnetsAPI` interface.

For detailed examples and instructions on writing your own subnet API, please refer to the [Writing your own subnet API](./docs/writing_your_own_subnet_api.md) documentation.
